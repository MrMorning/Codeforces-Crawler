# Codeforces Crawler
Codeforces is cosidered as the one of the most famous Competitive Programming Practice Platform.
Sometimes, I want to use my spare time(such as waiting for the bus, waiting in line to buy food) to solve some problems i've not totally solved. So I wrote this script to craw the problems on CF.

## Usage
1. put the problems' id in the file `list`.
2. run `python main.py` in your terminal.
3. use your chromium to open `output.html`.
4. export it into pdf or simply print it in the chromium.
